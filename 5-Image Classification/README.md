## Slides

The slides were obtained from [Brandon Rohrer's](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+BrandonRohrer) awesome YouTube video on convolutional neural networks, I highly recommend you go and have a look at it for an in depth explanation.

## Getting Started
The following software is recommended:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [TensorFlow™](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


## Hackathon - MNIST Classification

For this meetup we will get introduced with TensorFlow™ and use it to classify MNIST images.  You can work through the TensorFlow™ example page to implement the classifier using the MNIST data set. The tutorial page is located [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html)

If you just want to get into it quickly you can use the online [CovNetJs](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) site to play around with convolutional networks and experiment with the different parameters to see how that affects the learning rate. This site will run a JavaScript implementation of a convolutional neural network in your browser.  Be careful with pooling sizes though, if your images end up to big for the fully connected layer your browser might freeze trying to evaluate all the neurons.

## Libraries and languages

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The example page can be found here [MNIST For ML Beginners.](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html)

### Java

Java developers can make use of [deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/).  The turorial page for the MNIST data set can be found [here.](https://deeplearning4j.org/mnist-for-beginners)

### Others
You can refer to the slides for the other libraries available if you want to play around and investigate those as well.
